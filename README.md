# AWE
_Awesome Writing Environment_ (AWE) intends to be for authors what an Integrated Development Environment is for
programmers: a one-stop place where they can be productive and creative.


## Status

AWE is still alpha software, so use at your own risk. That said, feel free to download the latest 
[release](https://github.com/RemonSinnema/awe/releases) and let us know what you think.

Check out the [roadmap](https://github.com/RemonSinnema/awe/milestones) to get a sense of what features are planned for
the future. You can also [request a new feature](https://github.com/RemonSinnema/awe/issues) that isn't planned yet.
