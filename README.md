# AWE
_Awesome Writing Environment_ (AWE) is for authors what an Integrated Development Environment is for programmers: a
one-stop place where they can be productive and creative.

## Status

AWE is still alpha software, so use at your own risk. Check out the
[roadmap](https://github.com/RemonSinnema/awe/milestones) to get a sense of what features are planned. You can also 
[request a new feature](https://github.com/RemonSinnema/awe/issues) that isn't planned yet.
